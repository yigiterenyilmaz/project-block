# project_block

A Block Blast–style grid game with Balatro-style roguelike structure (rounds with
score thresholds, a deck of block cards, market between rounds). Jokers are in
(first wave); powers, elemental block types and the real market come later.
Unity 6 (6000.3.6f1), 2D URP, **new Input System only**.

## Layout

- `Assets/Scripts/Core/` — **all game rules.** Pure C# (`ProjectBlock.Core.asmdef`,
  `noEngineReferences`), deterministic via `IRandomSource`. Start reading at
  `Game/RoundEngine.cs` (turn state machine) and `Game/GameSession.cs` (run/rounds/market).
- `Assets/Scripts/Core/Jokers/` — the joker system. `Joker.cs` is the base type (all hooks
  are virtual no-ops), `JokerInventory.cs` is the only thing that calls them, and
  `Definitions/` holds one file per group of jokers.
- `Assets/Scripts/View/` — disposable debug UI (runtime-generated sprites + HUD).
  Never put rules here.
- `Assets/Scenes/enes.unity` — the working scene (a single `GameBootstrap` object).
  **Only ever modify this scene**, never SampleScene or the URP template.
- `Tools/CoreTests/` — console test harness (outside `Assets/`, so Unity ignores it).
- `docs/jokers-plan.md` — classification of all 31 planned jokers, the central rule
  rulings, and the open design questions. Update it as jokers land.

## Conventions (follow these)

- Every file starts with a `// PURPOSE:` header; extension points for future mechanics
  are marked `EXTENSION POINT`. Keep both up to date when editing.
- No `UnityEngine` and no un-seeded randomness inside `Core`.
- Rules that jokers/powers may bend live in mutable config objects (`RoundRules`,
  `ScoringConfig`) that the engine reads live — don't cache their values.
- Numbers in `ScoringConfig` / `DefaultRoundProgression` / the joker fields are balance
  placeholders; the flow around them is confirmed design.
- Turkish design terms → code names: el = `Hand`/turn, çekme destesi = `RoundDeck.DrawPile`,
  ıskarta = discard, oyun destesi = `GameSession.OwnedCards`, raunt = round,
  temizlik = clean sweep, bonus el = bonus hand, eşik = `RoundConfig.ScoreThreshold`,
  uzatma = overtime (playing on after the threshold), güç = power, ihale = auction.

## Joker rules (three decisions everything else follows from)

1. **Order is inventory order.** Every dispatch walks the jokers left to right
   (acquisition order). Score composes as: base values → all flat bonuses → all
   multipliers → floor once (`ScoreBreakdown`). A joker never overwrites another's value.
2. **Clean sweep is ONE central event.** Only `RoundEngine.TryResolveCleanSweep` may fire
   it, at most once per turn, and only when this turn's destruction emptied a board that
   was not already empty. Effects that can trigger a sweep call it; they never re-check
   the board themselves. This guard is what stops future sweep-exempt cubes (ice,
   obsidian, gold) from re-triggering a sweep on every later explosion.
3. **Overtime disabling is central.** A joker sets `DisabledInOvertime` and
   `JokerInventory` skips all of its hooks once `ThresholdPassed`. Never write
   `if (overtime)` inside a joker.

Add a joker: subclass `Joker`, override only the hooks you need, register it in
`JokerRegistry`. It appears in the debug joker bar automatically. Jokers do NOT subscribe
to `TurnResolved` — that event stays a post-fact notification for the UI.

## Testing

Core compiles and runs outside Unity:

- `dotnet run --project Tools/CoreTests` — assertion suite (jokers, score pipeline,
  charges, overtime gating, plus a fuzz pass over random joker sets). Exit code 1 on failure.
- `dotnet run --project Tools/CoreTests -- baseline` — deterministic scripted playthrough
  trace. **This is the regression net for Core refactors:** capture it before the change
  (`git stash` or `git archive HEAD` into a temp dir), capture it after, and diff. Base-game
  behaviour must stay byte-identical unless the change is intentional.

Test files compile INTO the Core assembly, so `internal` members are reachable.

In-editor: open the enes scene and press Play. Drag a card onto the board to place it,
A/C on offers, N leaves market, S redraws the hand, R restarts. Joker debug keys:
J grants the next joker from the registry, K sells the last one, 1-9 activate (a joker
that needs a target then waits for a click, Esc cancels).
