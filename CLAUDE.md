# project_block

A Block Blast–style grid game with Balatro-style roguelike structure (rounds with
score thresholds, a deck of block cards, market between rounds). Jokers are in
(first wave); powers, elemental block types and the real market come later.
Unity 6 (6000.3.6f1), 2D URP, **new Input System only**.

## Run structure

A run is **15 rounds** (`GameConfig.TotalRounds`). Surviving the last one ends the run in
`GamePhase.RunWon` — no market after it, and `GameOver` stays loss-only, so anything waiting
for a run to finish must accept **both** terminal phases. Every third round (3, 6, 9, 12, 15)
is flagged `RoundConfig.IsBossRound` by `DefaultRoundProgression.BossRoundInterval`; that flag
is the single source of truth for which rounds are boss rounds. Board size comes from
`DefaultRoundProgression.BoardSizeBands` — a fixed table covering exactly those 15 rounds
(1-5 on 5x5, 6-11 on 7x7, 12-15 on 9x9), and each band also names the `ShuffleErosion` that
punishes a stalling round. Run length and that table are meant to change together.

Anything that rebuilds a `RoundConfig` from another one (a joker/power `FilterRoundConfig`) must
use **`RoundConfig.WithBoard`**, never a hand-written `new RoundConfig(...)`: a field listed by
hand is a field that can be forgotten, and both `IsBossRound` and `Erosion` have already been
dropped that way once each.

- `Assets/Scripts/Core/Bosses/` — the boss system. `BossRound.cs` is the base type, and the
  engine is the only caller. A boss is the round's ANTAGONIST: not owned, not bought, not
  sellable, drawn by `GameSession.DrawBoss` (own rng, no repeats per run) and attached to the
  `RoundEngine` before its first turn. Three rules everything follows from:
  1. **One boss per round, round-scoped.** It dies with the engine, so a boss must NEVER mutate
     session state (`RoundRules`, `ScoringConfig`) to express a rule bend — that would leak into
     the next round. Bends are **queries** the engine asks live (`IgnoresBlockElements`,
     `BlocksPowerRecharge`, `DisablesJoker/Power`, `BlocksPlacementOn`, `ScoreLineExplosion`,
     `ScoreCleanSweep`, `OnlyCleanSweepsScore`, `FilterScoreThreshold`, `InvertsJokerScore`).
     The score bosses rewrite **base values only** — a joker's own bonuses always land on top.
     Read the round's bar from `RoundEngine.ScoreThreshold`, never `Config.ScoreThreshold`:
     a boss may ask for less and the two must never disagree.
     The deck taxes are the one exception: taking cards out of `OwnedCards` is their effect,
     not a rule bend.
  2. **Silencing is central**, like the overtime gate: `RoundEngine.IsSilencedByBoss` is checked
     by `JokerInventory.IsGated` and `PowerInventory`, so nothing is added/removed and no
     permanent effect gets undone and redone. Never test for a boss inside a joker or power.
     **Inverting is central too** (`InvertsJokerScore`, "Terslik"): `JokerInventory` opens a
     window around JOKER dispatch only, and inside it `ScoreBreakdown.AddFlat/AddMultiplier` and
     `Joker.Accrue` run backwards. Powers, base values and the engine's own bookkeeping share
     that breakdown and must never be caught by the window. A turn's `Total` floors at 0, so an
     inverted joker can empty a turn but never push the round score backwards.
  3. **The boss moves last** — after the player's own end-of-turn effects, but BEFORE the
     threshold and dead-end checks, so what it does can genuinely decide the round.
  Beware: bosses make frozen cards and sealed cells routine, so any driver that plays a card
  must skip `IsFrozen` cards and ask the board (never a raw `card.Has(...)`) where a block fits.

## Layout

- `Assets/Scripts/Core/` — **all game rules.** Pure C# (`ProjectBlock.Core.asmdef`,
  `noEngineReferences`), deterministic via `IRandomSource`. Start reading at
  `Game/RoundEngine.cs` (turn state machine) and `Game/GameSession.cs` (run/rounds/market).
- `Assets/Scripts/Core/Jokers/` — the joker system. `Joker.cs` is the base type (all hooks
  are virtual no-ops), `JokerInventory.cs` is the only thing that calls them, and
  `Definitions/` holds one file per group of jokers.
- `Assets/Scripts/View/` — disposable debug UI (runtime-generated sprites + HUD).
  Never put rules here.
- `Assets/Scenes/enes.unity` — the working scene (a single `GameBootstrap` object).
  **Only ever modify this scene**, never SampleScene or the URP template.
- `Tools/CoreTests/` — console test harness (outside `Assets/`, so Unity ignores it).
- `docs/jokers-plan.md` — classification of all 31 planned jokers, the central rule
  rulings, and the open design questions. Update it as jokers land.

## Conventions (follow these)

- Every file starts with a `// PURPOSE:` header; extension points for future mechanics
  are marked `EXTENSION POINT`. Keep both up to date when editing.
- No `UnityEngine` and no un-seeded randomness inside `Core`.
- Rules that jokers/powers may bend live in mutable config objects (`RoundRules`,
  `ScoringConfig`) that the engine reads live — don't cache their values.
- Numbers in `ScoringConfig` / `DefaultRoundProgression` / the joker fields are balance
  placeholders; the flow around them is confirmed design. One exception: a run is 15 rounds
  numbered 1-15, and the board-size table (`DefaultRoundProgression.BoardSizeBands` — rounds
  1-5 on 5x5, 6-11 on 7x7, 12-15 on 9x9) is confirmed design, not a knob to tune. There is
  no victory condition wired yet; the run still only ends by losing.
- **Board erosion is the anti-stalling clock.** Each band also names a `ShuffleErosion`: past
  `RoundRules.FreeDeckRecycles` (2), every time the draw pile runs DRY the arena loses a piece —
  the rim (1-5), a growing centre hole (6-11), or both (12-15). It is counted in
  `RoundEngine.DeckRecycleCount`, NOT `RoundDeck.ShuffleCount` (that also counts reshuffles the
  rules and jokers order), and applied once centrally at turn step 8.5. A cell eaten this way
  (`GameBoard.MarkDead`) KILLS its row and column — unlike a plain hole in the bounding box,
  which is merely skipped. Never conflate the two.
- Turkish design terms → code names: el = `Hand`/turn, çekme destesi = `RoundDeck.DrawPile`,
  ıskarta = discard, oyun destesi = `GameSession.OwnedCards`, raunt = round,
  temizlik = clean sweep, bonus el = bonus hand, eşik = `RoundConfig.ScoreThreshold`,
  uzatma = overtime (playing on after the threshold), güç = power, ihale = auction.

## Joker rules (three decisions everything else follows from)

1. **Order is inventory order.** Every dispatch walks the jokers left to right
   (acquisition order). Score composes as: base values → all flat bonuses → all
   multipliers → floor once (`ScoreBreakdown`). A joker never overwrites another's value.
2. **Clean sweep is ONE central event.** Only `RoundEngine.TryResolveCleanSweep` may fire
   it, at most once per turn, and only when this turn's destruction emptied a board that
   was not already empty. Effects that can trigger a sweep call it; they never re-check
   the board themselves. Note this is stricter than "a line exploded": a full line of
   indestructible cubes destroys nothing, so it no longer re-triggers a sweep every turn
   once obsidian/gold sit on the board.
3. **Overtime disabling is central.** A joker sets `DisabledInOvertime` and
   `JokerInventory` skips all of its hooks once `ThresholdPassed`. Never write
   `if (overtime)` inside a joker. Overtime itself follows the continue-cost rule
   (declining an offer reshuffles the hand and removes an escalating number of cards),
   so anything that hands the player a free discard recycle there — like `RedrawHand` —
   must be gated. That is why Renovasyon is overtime-disabled and İade is not.

4. **Destruction goes through the engine.** `RoundEngine.DestroyCubes` (and `ForceCleanSweep`
   / `DeclareLoss`) rather than `GameBoard` directly, so the destruction log
   (`TurnReport.DestroyedCubes`, with each cube's kind and source card), the countable
   tally and the sweep pre-condition all stay correct. A joker that opts out of counting
   (Buldozer) passes `countsForSweep: false` — that is also what keeps it out of
   "Kayıt defteri"'s ledger.

Add a joker: subclass `Joker`, override only the hooks you need, register it in
`JokerRegistry`. It appears in the debug joker bar automatically. Jokers do NOT subscribe
to `TurnResolved` — that event stays a post-fact notification for the UI.

All 35 planned jokers are implemented, and so are 17 of the 18 powers - only "Dolly" is
left, set aside by the designer. See `docs/jokers-plan.md`.

**Market credit ("Kredi kartı") is a SESSION rule, not joker state.** `GameSession` owns
`Debt`, `Spend` (own points first, borrow the shortfall) and `RepayDebt` (manual, market-only);
the joker is only the switch that turns `CreditAvailable` on and names the interest rate. The
debt compounds at every round end and a **boss round** that ends with it open ends the run
(`LossReason.DebtNotRepaid`) — checked BEFORE the final-round win, so round 15 can be survived
and still lost. A credit joker cannot be sold while it owes (`JokerInventory.CanSell`), which
is what stops the debt being walked away from.

- `Assets/Scripts/Core/Powers/` — the power system. `Power.cs` is the base type,
  `PowerInventory.cs` the only caller. Powers are ACTIVE: one charge, refilled by a clean
  sweep or a new round, at most one per turn, and using one never costs a turn.

## Testing

Core compiles and runs outside Unity:

- `dotnet run --project Tools/CoreTests` — assertion suite (jokers, score pipeline,
  charges, overtime gating, plus a fuzz pass over random joker sets). Exit code 1 on failure.
- `dotnet run --project Tools/CoreTests -- baseline` — deterministic scripted playthrough
  trace. **This is the regression net for Core refactors:** capture it before the change
  (`git stash` or `git archive HEAD` into a temp dir), capture it after, and diff. Base-game
  behaviour must stay byte-identical unless the change is intentional.

Test files compile INTO the Core assembly, so `internal` members are reachable.

In-editor: open the enes scene and press Play. Drag a card onto the board to place it,
A/C on offers, N leaves market, S redraws the hand, R restarts. Joker debug keys:
J grants the next joker from the registry, K sells the last one, 1-9 activate (a joker
that needs a target then waits for a click, Esc cancels).
